React Native Reusables encourages full customization by giving you control over how components look and behave. Two important parts of this flexibility are the `components.json` files and the theming system.

## What is `components.json`?

The `components.json` file serves as a configuration manifest for your project. It provides essential metadata and setup details, allowing tools to understand your project's structure and generate components accordingly. Key aspects include:

- **Style Configuration**: Defines the base style for components (e.g., `"style": "new-york"`).
- **Tailwind Integration**: Specifies paths to your Tailwind configuration and CSS files.
- **Color Palette**: Sets the base color for components (e.g., `"baseColor": "gray"`).
- **Theming Method**: Chooses between CSS variables or utility classes for theming (`"cssVariables": true`).
- **Aliases**: Maps custom paths for components and utilities, aiding in the organization and import process.

This file is particularly useful when using the CLI to initialize or add components, ensuring consistency and automation in your setup.

To implement your chosen theming style, adjust the `style` setting in your `components.json` file:

```json
{
  // ...
  "style": "new-york"
  // ...
}
```

Learn more about `components.json` in the [shadcn/ui components.json documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json).

## Theming

Theming in React Native Reusables allows you to define and apply consistent styles across your components. You can choose between CSS variables (recommended) or utility classes:

- **CSS Variables**: Enables global theming by defining variables like `--background` and `--foreground` in your css file. This approach allows for easy theme switching and customization.

```tsx
  <div className="bg-background text-foreground" />
```

<Callout title="Update theme.ts when changing CSS variables" type="warn">
  If you update or rename any CSS variables (like `--background`, `--primary`, etc.), don't forget to update `theme.ts` as well.
</Callout>

<div className="h-2" />

- **Utility Classes**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in your components for styling. This method offers granular control over individual component styles.

```tsx
  <div className="bg-zinc-950 dark:bg-white text-zinc-50 dark:text-zinc-950" />
```

Learn more about theming in the [shadcn/ui theming documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming).

## Tailwind Configuration

NativeWind currently uses Tailwind CSS v3, which means a `tailwind.config.ts` file is still required. This is where you:

- Extend the default theme (e.g. colors, spacing, border radius)

- Register custom class shortcuts or plugins

- Enable dark mode or other variants

- Without this config, utility classes like `bg-background` won't resolve correctly.

## `theme.ts`

The `theme.ts` file brings your theme into TypeScript.

<Callout title="Same variables as your CSS" >
  The values in `theme.ts` mirror the CSS variables defined in your global styles.
</Callout>

- Access to the same CSS variable values defined in your styles, directly in code

- Typed theme values for use in JavaScript/TypeScript logic

- Navigation theming via the `NAV_THEME` export, which plugs into react-navigation

This lets you keep both your styles and logic in sync with your app's theme.


<div className="h-2" />

React Native Reusables adapts these concepts for React Native, providing you with the same open, composable, and customizable foundation tailored for native apps.
