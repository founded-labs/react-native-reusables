React Native Reusables uses a theme system based on Tailwind CSS v3 and shadcn/ui. There are four files involved:

- `components.json` - used by the CLI to scaffold components with the correct paths and style  
- `global.css` - defines your light and dark themes using CSS variables  
- `tailwind.config.ts` - connects Tailwind classes to your CSS variables  
- `theme.ts` - mirrors those variables in TypeScript and includes the navigation theme  


## `components.json`

This works like [shadcn/ui's components.json](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json). It tells the CLI where to place files and which style to use (`default` or `new-york`). You can leave it alone unless you're changing paths or switching styles.

## `global.css`

Defines your theme using CSS variables under `:root` and `.dark:root` (for dark mode). Tailwind classes like `bg-background` and `text-foreground` use these variables.

You can choose a custom theme from [shadcn/ui themes](https://v3.shadcn.com/themes), but make sure to:

- Use the Tailwind v3 version (CSS variables)
- Replace `.dark` with `.dark:root` for compatibility with NativeWind

See the [full list of CSS variables](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming#list-of-variables) in the shadcn/ui documentation.

## `tailwind.config.ts`

Connects Tailwind utility classes (like `bg-card`, `text-muted`) to the CSS variables defined in `global.css`. It also sets the dark mode selector.

## `theme.ts`

Exports the same colors from `global.css` as a TypeScript object, so you can use them in logic, inline styles, or animations. Also includes `NAV_THEME` for the `ThemeProvider` in `_layout.tsx`.

If you update a CSS variable, update `theme.ts` as well.



<div className='text-sm text-muted-foreground *:text-muted-foreground py-px'>

<span className='font-medium'>Tip</span>: Use this prompt to sync `theme.ts` after updating CSS variables in `global.css`:

> Read CSS variables under `:root` and `.dark:root` in `global.css`.
> Update the `light` and `dark` entries in the `THEME` object in `theme.ts` to match these values in HSL format.
> Keep all keys and `NAV_THEME` unchanged.
> Add new variables if missing; comment stale ones if no matching CSS variable exists.
> Maintain the original formatting and key order.
