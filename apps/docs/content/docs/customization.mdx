React Native Reusables encourages full customization by giving you control over how components look and behave. Two important parts of this flexibility are the `components.json` files and the theming system.

## What is `components.json`?

The `components.json` file serves as a configuration manifest for your project. It provides essential metadata and setup details, allowing tools to understand your project's structure and generate components accordingly. Key aspects include:

- **Style Configuration**: Defines the base style for components (e.g., `"style": "new-york"`).
- **Tailwind Integration**: Specifies paths to your Tailwind configuration and CSS files.
- **Color Palette**: Sets the base color for components (e.g., `"baseColor": "gray"`).
- **Theming Method**: Chooses between CSS variables or utility classes for theming (`"cssVariables": true`).
- **Aliases**: Maps custom paths for components and utilities, aiding in the organization and import process.

This file is particularly useful when using the CLI to initialize or add components, ensuring consistency and automation in your setup.

To implement your chosen theming style, adjust the `style` setting in your `components.json` file:

```json
{
  // ...
  "style": "new-york"
  // ...
}
```

Learn more about `components.json` in the [shadcn/ui components.json documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json).


## Theming

Theming in React Native Reusables allows you to define and apply consistent styles across your components. You can choose between two methods:

- **CSS Variables**: Enables global theming by defining variables like `--background` and `--foreground` in your css file. This approach allows for easy theme switching and customization.
- **Utility Classes**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in your components for styling. This method offers granular control over individual component styles.


```tsx
<div className="bg-background text-foreground md:bg-muted" />
```

Learn more about theming in the [shadcn/ui theming documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming).


React Native Reusables adapts these concepts for React Native, providing you with the same open, composable, and customizable foundation tailored for native apps.
