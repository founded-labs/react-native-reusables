## August 2025 - Total Rewrite

New CLI. New docs. New registry. New showcase app.

### Now part of the Vercel OSS Program [#august-2025-vercel-oss]

React Native Reusables is now part of the [Vercel OSS Program](https://vercel.com/oss), which supports its continued growth and development.

### First React Native compatible shadcn registry _(probably)_ [#august-2025-first-react-native-compatible-shadcn-registry]

You can now use `npx shadcn@latest` with our registries built just for React Native.

To make the experience even smoother, we built a thin wrapper around the CLI.

- No need to copy long registry URLs

- You can use `--all` to install everything at once

- If you skip the component name, you'll get a multi-select prompt

<CommandTabs args={["add"]} />

Same power, tailored for React Native.

### Standardize rem to match web behavior [#august-2025-standardize-rem]

In the `metro.config.js`, `inlineRem` is now set to `16` to match web behavior.

```diff title="metro.config.js"
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');
const { withNativeWind } = require('nativewind/metro');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

- module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css' });
+ module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css', inlineRem: 16 });
```

### Enhanced iOS portal rendering with FullWindowOverlay [#august-2025-fullwindowoverlay-ios]

All portal content on iOS is now wrapped with `FullWindowOverlay` from `react-native-screens` to improve rendering and ensure seamless integration with native navigation.

### New CLI - rewritten with Effect + shadcn [#august-2025-new-cli-rewritten-with-effect-shadcn]

The CLI has been rebuilt from the ground up with [`effect`](https://effect.website) and the [`shadcn`](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) engine under the hood for the add command.

Features:

- `doctor` command to diagnose and fix certain config/setup issues

- Registry-aware component scaffolding

- Stronger foundation for future updates

<CommandTabs args={["doctor"]} />

### Improved component architecture [#august-2025-improved-component-architecture]

Every component has been refined and standardized for both `default` and `new-york` styles.

- Improved platform-specific logic

- Easier to override and customize


### Blocks [#august-2025-blocks]

- TODO

### Showcase App [#august-2025-showcase-app]

We launched a new Expo app so you can explore components from your device.

- TODO: add link to app

### Redesigned Docs [#august-2025-redesigned-docs]

The docs have been rebuilt from scratch as you can see.

- TODO: Add before and after images

### New GitHub Home [#august-2025-new-github-home]

We moved the repo from my personal account to a dedicated org:

- [@founded-labs](https://github.com/founded-labs)

This gives the project a long-term home with more room to grow.

### New Icon component [#august-2025-new-icon-component]

A single icon component to replace all icons from the deprecated `/lib/icons` directory.

**Install the new icon component with the CLI**

<CommandTabs args={["add", "icon"]} />


```tsx
// Example usage
import { Icon } from '@/components/ui/icon';
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-react-native';

<Icon as={HeartIcon} className="size-4 text-red-500" />

```

### Text variants [#august-2025-text-variants]

The `Text` component now includes built-in typography variants, so you no longer need to use the deprecated `Typography` components like `<Typography.H1>`.

Use the variant prop like this:

```tsx
<Text variant="h1">Title</Text>
```

Available variants: `default`, `h1` , `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `p`, `block-quote`, `code`, `lead`, `large`, `small`, and `muted`.

### Deprecated [#august-2025-deprecated]

- `lib/constants.ts`: now using the `theme.ts` file.

- `lib/useColorScheme.ts`: now using the hook directly from `nativewind`

- `lib/icons`: deprecated in favor of the new [`Icon`](#august-2025-new-icon-component) component.

- `components/ui/typography.tsx`: deprecated in favor of the new [`variant`](#august-2025-text-variants) prop on the `Text` component.

### Upgrade Notes [#august-2025-upgrade-notes]
1. Run the `doctor` command to diagnose. Then, follow the instructions to get your project up to date:

<CommandTabs args={["doctor"]} />

2. Update your components by running the `add` command with `--override` and list the components from your project:

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure you commit your changes before running the add command and use the diff view to see what's changed and to keep
  your own custom changes.
</Callout>

<CommandTabs args={["add", "--override", "[...components]"]} />
